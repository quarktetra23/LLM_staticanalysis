PROBLEM C: Graph behing a subgraph of another graph

You are given two undirected graphs G₁ and G₂, represented as adjacency lists. Your task is to determine whether either of the two graphs is a subgraph of the other.
A graph G₁ = (V₁, E₁) is said to be a subgraph of graph G₂ = (V₂, E₂) if:

  1. Every vertex in V₁ is mapped to a distinct vertex in V₂ (i.e., an injective mapping), and
  2. Every edge in E₁ is also present between the corresponding mapped vertices in E₂.

You must write a function that returns:
  1. "G1 is a subgraph of G2" if G₁ is a subgraph of G₂,
  2. "G2 is a subgraph of G1" if G₂ is a subgraph of G₁,
  3."Neither is a subgraph of the other" otherwise.

Constraints:
  1. Each graph contains at most 8 nodes.
  2. The graphs are undirected and unweighted.
  3. There are no self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.

Write this in [your language]. This code will be put through the static code analyzer [the analyzer you are using] to check the quality of code writing the quality of code writing
